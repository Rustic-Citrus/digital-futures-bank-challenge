### Introduction

Banking operations have evolved significantly over the past hundred years. At the beginning of the twentieth-century, credit cards simply did not exist in the UK. By the 1980's, they had become commonplace. Equally, the average account holder had to go to the local branch of the bank to have the majority of their concerns answered until 2010, but over the past decade, branches have been closing across the UK as consumers move to digital banking, where most of their interactions with their bank are carried out through an app on their smartphones.

Thompson Family Banking Ltd has seen substantial growth in recent years, especially as other banks have switched to digital. Nevertheless, there is a clear market segment that Thompson Banking has missed out on, which is the group of young adults, whose parents have accounts with Thompson, and are looking to open their first accounts. This group has grown up using their smartphones for almost everything, and they are looking to do the same for their bank accounts. However, many young people are concerned with sustainability, and are reluctant to support traditional banks, many of whom have historically financed fossil fuel industries.

In order to capture this new market, Thompson Family Banking Ltd has reached out to Digital Futures to create an example of a basic application that could be used for their accounts as they migrate to digital banking. It provides a step up from Thompson's manual banking operations and gives some insight into how automated banking could increase the company's productivity as the company enters this new phase. With that in mind, our Software Engineering Team has created this application for Thompson Banking as a pilot project.

### Benefits

As mentioned above, many banks are now transitioning to digital banking, which is primarily carried out through apps developed for Android and iOS devices. Our application uses the command-line interface (CLI), which has never truly been a means for customers to interact with their accounts. However, they were used within financial organisations for professionals to automate operations and manage databases. Since Thompson Banking is a paper-based company, we are making a comparison between manual, paper-based system of banking and a digital, CLI banking system rather than a graphical-user interface (GUI) system. We hope that, if our pilot project suits the needs of Thompson Family Banking Ltd, then our Software Engineering Team will receive the go-ahead to work on a smartphone application with a GUI. That being said, there are several advantages that a CLI system has over a paper-based system.

#### Increased operational efficiency

Paper-based operations are inherently prone to errors that digital systems are not. Since paper records occupy a physical space, they have to be stored in a physical container. With that comes the requirement for humans to move and access records manually. The reading and writing of a file on a computer typically takes milliseconds or seconds. For a human, it could take minutes or potentially hours to a find a physical document as they walk to a storeroom, search through a filing system with records that may not be stored efficiently, and finally read and process the information. Digital systems save companies time. Thus, they save companies money.

#### Increased data reliability and safety

Besides the time investment required to read, write and store a written document, there is also an increased risk. Mould, fire and natural disasters are all ways in which a paper-based system could be compromised, and if a customer's banking data is lost, it could be severely detrimental to their well-being. With digital systems, backups are performed at regular intervals to an external database, often spread across a number of locations around the world. For a customer, this means that, even if their local branch is flooded or catches fire, their financial data is safe.

#### Faster service for customers

In the past, it could take days or even weeks for banks to cash a cheque. They had to be physically sent to the payer's bank for clearing, then, someone had to manually verify it to make sure the cheque was valid. Today, a cheque can be cashed on the same day, primarily due to digital systems. In the same sense, many of the paper-based operations that a bank performs can be automated through programming languages, which ultimately results in faster service for that bank's customers.
